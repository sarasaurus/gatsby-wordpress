# Homework
* Write summary of key research themes

* Write 1-3 personas depending on research findings (Needs & Goals,
Behaviors & Beliefs)


#### Personas are a representation of your target user

* Can be 1 or more (primary and secondary)

* Only include essential demographics (remove bias)

* Demographics can cause assumptions, shortcuts in thinking, and subconscious stereotypes by team members.

* Does gender matter? Does ethnicity matter?

* Can be written in first (“I need…”) or third person (“Will needs…”)

* User goals/tasks, pain points, attitudes, motivations, technology aptitude

* Write 1-2 sentence summary in user’s voice

* Should feel like a real person

* Based on real research (ideally)

#### Purpose

* Build a common understanding of the user across teams

* Identify opportunities and product gaps to drive strategy

* Humanize your target users, including their behaviors, goals, and expectations

* Reminder of who the average user is (which is not anyone at your company)

* Consider users that aren’t always front of mind

* Users with disabilities like mental disorders, visually impaired, etc.
