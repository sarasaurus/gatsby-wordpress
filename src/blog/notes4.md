#### Homework Review
homework was to create wireframes 
1. what did you learn  
    *  easy to over complicate
    * important to iterate
    * think about WHO is actually using your product
2. what surprised you?
3. what would you do differently
4. wuestions about ux?  

there are image scanners in use in japan re checkout

## Intro to Prototyping
a simulation or sample of the final product
common steps: 
  1. sketches: brainstorming
  2. wireframe: communication (content, layout)
  3. mock up: communication (visual design)
  4. protoype: (simulation, interaction experience)
      * think how do you wnat people to feel
      * if things take longer what are you trying to achieve?      

Low-fidelity -- POP app

## WHY make a prototype?
to test your hypothesis, and to help people understand your solution and the problem-- like a demonstration for stakeholders
accessibility testing-- super important, to communicate the problem to people who dont know--
all design to engage and drive empathy

Prototype CRITICAL FLOWS FIRST--- only what you need--
think WHAT DO YOU WANT TO LEARN-- don't do it all!!!
think CORE INTERACTION

set expectations for the testers-- hey this is a prototype, not everything works-- just the core interactions
* Review your problem statements
* How can you validate with your prototype  

__OMG these paper protypes are amazing....__  
* you can use __Invision__(you can import images and then add hotspots to simulate interaction, its super easy), __POP app__ (for phone), __UXPin__ (instructor uses this one a lot), __Axure__ (is great for forms-- it can handle complex logic, but its cumbersome... its one of the biggest enterprise tools... but its a little slow) 
* HTML/CSS -- could i create a protype with gatsby and material UI? __FramerJS__
* Powerpoint / Keynote <-- you can do quite a bit with this  
* Physical space - styroforam, cardboard  
Adobe XD offers weekly challenges

### Part of your homework will be to do a protoype and then usability test with a friend  
>_if you want a great product you must test!_  

### Test Plan
> goals of the test  
> research questions  
> characteristics of your participants
> description of methodology  
> list of tasks  
    * think about what you want people to accomplish  
    * a single user research session typically takes about 30 minutes  
>moderator script  
>post-test questionare
> do a run through (pilot test)--> make sure there are no testing glitches

give testers a context--   
example: you're at this parking meter for the first time-- what catches your attention, walk me through the steps and talk outloud, if their face changes ask them questions

__conducting the test__  
establish rapport  
try super hard not to lead the tester -- no that screen was super hard huh, think: got it, versus good... try to keep acknowledgment neutral  
avoid extraneous body language or jargon  
often good to time people  
record people!  
then create a highlight reel   
after reviewing reserach, instructor will do affinity mapping (post-its) with team members  

### GOALS and QUESTIONS
1.  How might we make the search easier and less frustrating
2. How can we utilise the loyalty program to incentivize and streamline
3. 

sooo
#### 2-3 Goals
how can we make the non-barcode checkout system...  
easier  
faster  
and more personal  
#### 2-3 tasks
* you're buying an apple with out a barcode
you're not sure exactly what the apple is called
* you're buying broccoli, you know exactly what it is
* you're on your phone, and rushed for a meeting, buying bananas
* you're buying something you've bought many times before
* you're buying a large watermelon, its too large place on the scale

in your presentation-- what did you learn, what would you do next
think about what was the flow-- how did you think about it, what is the story of my design, what choices did i make and why  
think 5 slides  
plus then a demonstration of your prototype
