#### SOME OF OUR IDEAS
* using image recognition to identify what the customer is placing on the scale without the customer needing to do anything
  * the idea being that the image recognition would pull up a more specific menu for the user to select from -- like leafy greans or apples or bananas 
* starting the non-barcode screen with common items from the customer's loyalty account
* including some sort of reward or insentive program to make shopping feel more fun like waze
* include PLU numbers more prominently in the produce section
* have a start or intro screen that displays some frequently or recently purchased items

#### USER FLOW DIAGRAM
